## Why

- Give programmer the illusion as if writing for a single system
- SQL is too limited for many application
	- Cannot express common patterns like loops well enough
- MapReduce introduced simplified programming model for parallel computation
	- But does not have a type-system helping developers making sure the correct data is transferred between stages
