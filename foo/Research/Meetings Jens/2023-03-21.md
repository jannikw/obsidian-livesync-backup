- Python code generation
	- iterator model
	- support push based operation for streaming
	- long term: move to more performant execution
- Integrating user defined operators
	- problems
		- different data representations and conversions
		- requirement of language runtimes
			- do not limit use of language specific packages
	- different levels
		- deeply integrated
			- require machine code and proper callback
			- data format dictated by system
		- low integration
			- external process for language runtime
			- requires data conversion/serialization

- data types for UDF/UDOs?
	- atoms, tuples, arrays etc.
- Optimizing UDFs
	- attributes given by developer
	- automatically detected
- Keep computation in external runtime
	- save conversions
	- combine mutliple UDOs in other runtime
